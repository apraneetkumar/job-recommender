# job-recommender

Students in their final semester of Graduate school like me are all hunting for their dream jobs and everyone has their own parameters to zero down on the ideal match for them such as Work Life Balance, Pay, Growth, Learning, Remote Working, etc. In this project, I am scraping verified reviews from www.teamblind.com companies in the Tech, Finance, and Consulting sectors to prioritize companies based on different parameters.

The key steps of this project are - 

- Scraping reviews for chosen companies with atleast 50 reviews
- Data cleaning and pre-processing
- Lift analysis to identify the strength of association between each parameter and company
- Recommendation system based on Bag of Words Cosine Similarity
